# Tungsten

An inventory of compiler tooling

Currently building üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Getting Started

Quick setup to get the compiler running:

```bash
# ensure Rust is installed locally; if not, install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# if Rust and Cargo are not in PATH, add them
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

# reload shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc   # For zsh
source ~/.bashrc  # For bash

# ensure Cargo is installed
cargo --version
```

## Progress
